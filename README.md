Diabetes mellitus refers to a group of diseases that affect how the body uses blood sugar
(glucose). Glucose is an important source of energy for the cells that make up the muscles
and tissues. It&#39;s also the brain&#39;s main source of fuel. The main cause of diabetes varies by
type. But no matter what type of diabetes you have, it can lead to excess sugar in the blood.
Too much sugar in the blood can lead to serious health problems. Risk factors for diabetes
includes family history of diabetes, older age, overweight, race (African American, Hispanic
or Latino, American Indian, or Alaska Native person are at higher risk). In addition to the
beforementioned risk factors, for patients with diabetes, one reason for hospitalization and
unplanned hospital readmission is severe dysglycemia (uncontrolled hyperglycemia – high
blood sugar, or hypoglycemia – low blood sugar).
The aim of this project is to assess risk factors that may relate to early hospital readmission
for potential diabetes patients, to find future directions which might lead to improvements
in patients&#39; safety.
